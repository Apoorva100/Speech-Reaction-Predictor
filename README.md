# Speech-reaction-predictor

Overview -

This project aims to predict basic audience reactions (e.g., claps, laughter) to speeches using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. It leverages TensorFlow and Keras for building a neural network that understands speech text and GloVe embeddings for word representation.

Features -

Predict audience reactions based on speech text.
Utilize pre-trained GloVe embeddings for enhanced text understanding.
Implement a Bidirectional LSTM model for sequence processing.
